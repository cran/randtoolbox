=== randtoolbox: an R package for random number generation and tests ===

Version 1.06
=============

BUG FIXES

- the degree of freedom is now correct for the order test.

BUG REPORT

- Astley Lin reports that the degree-of-freedom(df) of 
chi-square test is wrong for the order test.

Version 1.05
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add new WELL generators based on L'Ecuyer's code.
- add the Sobol and Halton sequences from fOptions package.

BUG FIXES

- Yes, it compiles on 64bit linux both on CRAN and R-forge.

Version 1.04
=============

BUG REPORT

- the package does not compil on Fedora 8 x86_64 boxes.


Version 1.03
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add the WELL generator thanks to the code of P. L'Ecuyer.
- SFMT now allows for different mersenne exponents as well as parameter sets.
- increase the possible dimension for Torus algorithm from 1000 to 100 000.
- add the RAN_ARRAY generator of Knuth TAOCP (2002)
- the function setRandSeed has be renamed by setSeed.
- update the vignette.


Version 1.02
=============

NEW FEATURES

- more random generation tests such as collision test and order test.
- poker test is generalized to any dimension.
- some auxiliary functions.
- a detailed vignette on generating and testing random generation.

BUG FIXES

- on windows, when the seed was not fixed by the user, we use the machine
time. But we use only seconds of machine time not micro second like on 
unix-like system. Hence a call like this
> for(i in 1:10) print(congruRand(1))
produces the same output. Now it is fixed.

Version 1.01 (never released)
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add withtorus option for SFMT function.
- improve output of tests.


Version 1.00
=============

- Initial release based on the torus package (which is no longer available).
