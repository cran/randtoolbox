=== randtoolbox: an R package for random number generation and tests ===

Version 1.09
=============

NEW FEATURES

- start runif interface for congruential generator and WELL RNG,
- vignette contains two chapters,
- start to test true randomness (not included in this version),
- increase the speed and accuracy of Halton and Sobol sequences.

STRUCTURAL CHANGE

- extract Pierre L'Ecuyer's code from randtoolbox and 
put it in a dedicated package rngWELL,
- change the licence of randtoolbox from GPL to BSD licence,
- depends now on rngWELL.

BUG FIXES
- normal transformation of Halton and Sobol sequences is correct.

BUG REPORT

- Halton and Sobol sequences did not work on 64bit architecture when
using normal transformation reported by Anirban Mukherjee,
- Sobol sequences for dimension > 2 need to be tested.

Version 1.08 (never released on CRAN)
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add function get.primes,
- table of primes moved from randtoolbox.c to primes.h and compressed
  by storing half difference from the previous prime instead of each
  prime (except for 2 and 3),
- start runifinterface.

Version 1.07
=============

NEW FEATURES

- integrate code for Halton, Sobol sequence from fBasics (Rmetrics),
- randoolbox is now part of Rmetrics project (available on R-forge),
- increase the speed of congruRand.

BUG FIXES

- fix setSeed function,
- a warning shows up on 64 bit architecture.

BUG REPORT

- setting the seed with WELL's RNGs was not correct, 
reported by Petr Savicky.

Version 1.06
=============

BUG FIXES

- the degree of freedom is now correct for the order test.

BUG REPORT

- Astley Lin reports that the degree-of-freedom(df) of 
chi-square test is wrong for the order test.

Version 1.05
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add new WELL generators based on L'Ecuyer's code,
- add the Sobol and Halton sequences from fOptions package.

BUG FIXES

- Yes, it compiles on 64bit linux both on CRAN and R-forge.

Version 1.04
=============

BUG REPORT

- the package does not compil on Fedora 8 x86_64 boxes,
reported by Brian Ripley.


Version 1.03
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add the WELL generator thanks to the code of P. L'Ecuyer,
- SFMT now allows for different mersenne exponents as well as parameter sets,
- increase the possible dimension for Torus algorithm from 1000 to 100 000,
- add the RAN_ARRAY generator of Knuth TAOCP (2002),
- the function setRandSeed has be renamed by setSeed,
- update the vignette.


Version 1.02
=============

NEW FEATURES

- more random generation tests such as collision test and order test,
- poker test is generalized to any dimension,
- some auxiliary functions,
- a detailed vignette on generating and testing random generation.

BUG FIXES

- on windows, when the seed was not fixed by the user, we use the machine
time. But we use only seconds of machine time not micro second like on 
unix-like system. Hence a call like this
> for(i in 1:10) print(congruRand(1))
produces the same output. Now it is fixed.

Version 1.01 (never released on CRAN)
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add withtorus option for SFMT function,
- improve output of tests.


Version 1.00
=============

- Initial release based on the torus package (which is no longer available).
