=== randtoolbox: an R package for random number generation and tests ===


Version 1.03
=============

NEW FEATURES
- add the WELL generator thanks to the code of P. L'Ecuyer.
- SFMT now allows for different mersenne exponents as well as parameter sets.
- increase the possible dimension for Torus algorithm from 1000 to 100 000.
- add the RAN_ARRAY generator of Knuth TAOCP (2002)
- the function setRandSeed has be renamed by setSeed.
- update the vignette.


Version 1.02
=============

NEW FEATURES

- more random generation tests such as collision test and order test.
- poker test is generalized to any dimension.
- some auxiliary functions.
- a detailed vignette on generating and test random generation.

BUG FIXES

- on windows, when the seed was not fixed by the user, we use the machine
time. But we use only seconds of machine time not micro second like on 
unix-like system. Hence a call like this
> for(i in 1:10)print(congruRand(1))
produces the same output. Now it is fixed.

Version 1.01 (never released)
=============

NEW FEATURES

- add withtorus option for SFMT function.
- improve output of tests.



Version 1.00
=============

- Initial release.
- Contains functions bstraub(), simpf(), rearrangepf() and panjer(),
  and the dataset hachemeister.
